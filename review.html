    <td>Response #2: I personally enjoyed the lecture of the course. They were more informative than any other resource.</td>
    <td>Response #2: I would recommend this course to all computer science majors who are interested in operating systems.</td>

    <td>Response #3: flexibility</td>
    <td>Response #3: If it was not required I would not take it was informative</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Response #4: Good introduction to new technology and online resources. The assignments were well thought out and great practice for different types of languages I had never tried writing before.</td>
    <td>Response #4: Operating systems is a course that's very important to understand especially if you are a computer science major</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Response #5: The quizzes were straightforward and didn't encounter questions I wasn't anticipating</td>
    <td>Response #5: Dr. Sajid is a gifted educator whose dedication to knowledge and learning are not found among lesser professors. He does not embarrass or hound students over foolish questions or mistakes, instead he takes the time to reinforce everybody's understanding of the material, it's like he sees every interaction between his students and himself as an opportunity for us to improve ourselves. He takes the time to clearly demonstrate new concepts, using examples, problems, and documentation all at the right times. He also always makes time for his students, for instance he came in on a day he wasn't even on campus to give me guidance on an assignment I had difficulty grasping. Thats dedication which not many professors share, he is also very approachable and quick to respond to any emails. I can't imagine the strength of will that it takes for him to set such a standard, but I'm thankful that I had the opportunity learn from him. Thank you Dr. Sajid for a wonderful semester.</td>

    <td>Response #6: The final project was neat</td>
    <td>Response #6: I think this course can be easy if you listen to the lectures and do the assignments.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Response #7: The course was informational</td>
    <td>Response #7: Its just not for everyone</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Response #8: I really appreciated the structure of this course. One aspect that stood out to me was how the essential concepts were regularly emailed to us. This allowed for further research if we didn't fully grasp them during class. The flexibility to explore and understand the material at our own pace was valuable. Additionally, the grading system, where only the highest 4 out of 6 assignments and quizzes counted, provided a sense of relief. It acknowledged that everyone has off days or might struggle with certain topics, allowing us to focus on improvement rather than being overly concerned about every single assessment. Furthermore, the instructor's accessibility was a key factor for me. The option to email or talk to them after class about any problems or uncertainties demonstrated a genuine commitment to supporting students. This approachability made the learning experience more interactive and collaborative.</td>
    <td>Response #8: I would recommend this course for several reasons. Firstly, if you are focused on maintaining a good grade, the instructor's approach of emailing 10 questions before the quiz, with 4 of them appearing on the actual quiz, provides a clear advantage. This method allows students to prioritize their efforts and ensures that even if they encounter difficulties, there's a manageable set of questions to focus on for assessment. Moreover, the grading system, where only the highest 4 out of 6 assignments and quizzes count, adds a level of flexibility. This takes off some pressure, acknowledging that everyone may have off days or struggle with specific topics. It encourages students to concentrate on improvement rather than being overly concerned about every single assessment, which can be particularly beneficial for those who might find certain concepts challenging. For individuals who are genuinely interested in learning the material, the assignments and projects seem to be effective tools for gaining a deeper understanding. The instructor's commitment to providing additional questions for self-study and delving into each slide in more detail during class demonstrates a dedication to facilitating a comprehensive learning experience.</td>

    <td>Response #15: Prof. Sajid takes the approach of teaching that is needed for

 these types of classes- hands-on. Never have I realized how effective being taught the basics, then being thrown head-first into a lab is, until taking this class. I was intellectually challenged, taught different approaches to the same problem, and felt that my work was directly beneficial in advancing my future career. 10/10 course :D</td>
    <td></td>

  <tr>
    <td>Response #16: Prof Sajid is a very amazing professor. During labs, I specifically remember struggling with some of the material. I enjoyed the step-by-step instructions and he was always available to consulate during and outside of class. It is amazing to have a professor that is supportive and wants the best for me and my classmates.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Response #17: Hands-on labs are a fantastic way of learning about different security vulnerabilities and tools in different operating systems. I appreciate that multiple operating systems were provided to us, including Kali, Ubuntu, Fedora, and Windows 7. These labs were fun and challenging to complete and greatly enhanced my learning in this course. This is also one of the rare courses where I feel that the required group work benefited my learning. It felt like a Cyber Defense Club meeting, and that is a very good thing in my opinion. The lectures were full of great information regarding operating systems security, and concepts were explained clearly and concisely by the professor.</td>
