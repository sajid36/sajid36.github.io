    <td>Response #5: Dr. Sajid is a gifted educator whose dedication to knowledge and learning are not found among lesser professors. He does not embarrass or hound students over foolish questions or mistakes, instead he takes the time to reinforce everybody's understanding of the material, it's like he sees every interaction between his students and himself as an opportunity for us to improve ourselves. He takes the time to clearly demonstrate new concepts, using examples, problems, and documentation all at the right times. He also always makes time for his students, for instance he came in on a day he wasn't even on campus to give me guidance on an assignment I had difficulty grasping. Thats dedication which not many professors share, he is also very approachable and quick to respond to any emails. I can't imagine the strength of will that it takes for him to set such a standard, but I'm thankful that I had the opportunity learn from him. Thank you Dr. Sajid for a wonderful semester.</td>

    <td>Response #8: I really appreciated the structure of this course. One aspect that stood out to me was how the essential concepts were regularly emailed to us. This allowed for further research if we didn't fully grasp them during class. The flexibility to explore and understand the material at our own pace was valuable. Additionally, the grading system, where only the highest 4 out of 6 assignments and quizzes counted, provided a sense of relief. It acknowledged that everyone has off days or might struggle with certain topics, allowing us to focus on improvement rather than being overly concerned about every single assessment. Furthermore, the instructor's accessibility was a key factor for me. The option to email or talk to them after class about any problems or uncertainties demonstrated a genuine commitment to supporting students. This approachability made the learning experience more interactive and collaborative.</td>
    <td>Response #8: I would recommend this course for several reasons. Firstly, if you are focused on maintaining a good grade, the instructor's approach of emailing 10 questions before the quiz, with 4 of them appearing on the actual quiz, provides a clear advantage. This method allows students to prioritize their efforts and ensures that even if they encounter difficulties, there's a manageable set of questions to focus on for assessment. Moreover, the grading system, where only the highest 4 out of 6 assignments and quizzes count, adds a level of flexibility. This takes off some pressure, acknowledging that everyone may have off days or struggle with specific topics. It encourages students to concentrate on improvement rather than being overly concerned about every single assessment, which can be particularly beneficial for those who might find certain concepts challenging. For individuals who are genuinely interested in learning the material, the assignments and projects seem to be effective tools for gaining a deeper understanding. The instructor's commitment to providing additional questions for self-study and delving into each slide in more detail during class demonstrates a dedication to facilitating a comprehensive learning experience.</td>
